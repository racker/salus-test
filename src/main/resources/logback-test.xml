This particular logback config file was needed since the loggers below were not being influenced
by setting the Spring Boot logging.level property at the unit test class level.
-->

<configuration>

  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml" />
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/console-appender.xml" />

  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/>
  </root>

   -->
  <logger name="org.testcontainers" level="INFO"/>
  <logger name="com.github.dockerjava" level="WARN"/>
